    <h1>My Favorite Movies and Series</h1>
    <p>
      After getting all the work done, some snacks and watching a good movie or
      series is a perfect activity. As you can see I'm actually a
      <strong>series person</strong> more than movie.
    </p>
    <p>Here is the list of some of my favorite movies and series.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Friends</b>
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          This series, which tells about the years of friendship of 6 friends
          living in Manhattan, is one of my favorite sitcoms.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't remember how many times I watched it, but it's still a series
          that I watch when I want to feel good.

        <b>Anne with an E</b>
        <br />

        <p>
          Based on "Anne of Green Gables.", a 13-year-old orphan girl searches
          for family, love and acceptance throughout her life in the orphanage.

          I had a small smile on my face when I finished this series that I saw
          and watched by chance on Netflix. I was very surprised that this
          series, which also deals with many social problems, lasted for 2
          seasons.

      <li>
        <b>Harry Potter</b>
        <br />

          Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British
          author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young
          wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron
          Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
          Wizardry.

        <p>
          The world is divided into Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter lovers.
          I'm probably in the team Harry Potter. My favorite movie of this
          series that I watched for the first time in the cinema is
          <strong>"The Goblet of Fire"</strong>.

      <li>
        <b>Modern Family</b>
        <br />
        <br />

        <p>
          Three modern-day families from California try to deal with their kids,
          quirky spouses and jobs in their own unique ways, often falling into
          hilarious situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modern Family is another sitcom I love, with each character unique and
          the funniest way to tell about still being a family in any situation.
