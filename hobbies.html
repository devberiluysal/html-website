          Singing has been one of my biggest passions since my childhood. I was
          always dreamed myself on the stage while I was singing with hair brush
          in my hand. :)
        </p>
        <p>It was a wonderful feeling that one day this dream came true.</p>
        <p>These days I'm taking singing lessons to sing more accurately.</p>

        <p>
          I definitely spend a moment of my day doing sports. Because keeping
          our body healthy is very important to us. In my opinion, sports are a
          good treatment method not only physically, but also mentally. When I
          think of taking time for myself, the first thing that comes to my mind
          is doing sports.

        <p>
          I have been a licensed table tennis player since I was 10 years old.
          Besides, <strong>swimming</strong> and
          <strong> reformer pilates </strong>are one of my other favorite
          sports.

        <br />
        <p>The world is not just our little fishbowl. :)</p>
        <p>
          One of my favorite activities is to see the traces left by people in
          billions of years of worldly life, and to see the existence of
          different cultures and lives in this world we share.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, I only had the opportunity to travel in my own country and
          European countries. But I can't wait to see more.
